    blurb: 'High pressured jets of water, used as a water jet cutter, mixed with an abrasive substance could be used to cut hard materials such as wood or rubber. Waterjet cutting is often used during fabrication of machine parts. It is the preferred method when the materials being cut are sensitive to the high temperatures generated by other methods. Waterjet cutting is used in various industries, including mining and aerospace, for cutting, shaping, and reaming.'

    blurb: 'This shows a wifi heat map, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation. These consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum. The oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave. The wavefront of electromagnetic waves emitted from a point source (such as a light bulb) is a sphere. The position of an electromagnetic wave within the electromagnetic spectrum can be characterized by either its frequency of oscillation or its wavelength.'

    blurb: 'Resonance is a phenomenon in which a vibrating system or external force drives another system to oscillate with greater amplitude at a specific preferential frequency. At these resonant frequencies, small periodic driving forces have the ability to produce large amplitude oscillations, due to the storage of vibrational energy. An example includes the collapse of the Tacoma Bridge in 1940 due to strong winds causing vibrations that led to its collapse.'

Focal length also affects the kind of image your camera captures, as well. A very short focal length will allow a photographer to capture a wider field of view, while a very long focal length (say, a telephoto lens) will cut the area you"re imaging down to a much smaller window.'

    blurb: "The cohesive forces between liquid molecules are responsible for the phenomenon known as surface tension. The molecules at the surface do not have other like molecules on all sides of them and consequently they cohere more strongly to those directly associated with them on the surface. This forms a surface 'film' which makes it more difficult to move an object through the surface than to move it when it is completely submersed. This interesting insect can freely run along the surface of a quiet pond. It's tiny mass and the geometry of its legs allow it to be supported by the high surface tension of water."

It is the quantum excitation of the Higgs field a fundamental field of crucial importance to particle physics theory first suspected to exist in the 1960s. Unlike other known fields such as the electromagnetic field, it has a non-zero constant value in vacuum. The question of the Higgs field's existence has been the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics and, according to some, 'the central problem in particle physics'"

    blurb: "The genetics term heterozygous refers to a pair of genes where one is dominant and one is recessive — they're different.It has to do with traits you inherited from your parents that are different.Let's say your dad's eyes are brown, your mom's eyes are blue, and those heterozygous chromosomes led to your having green eyes. If you inherited the same gene from both parents, it's homozygous — the same. An organism's genotype is its pairing of alleles for a specific gene. Genotypes, unlike phenotypes, can be homozygous or heterozygous. If an organism is heterozygous for a gene, or possesses one of each allele, then the dominant trait is expressed. A recessive allele is only expressed if an organism is homozygous for that trait, or posses two recessive alleles."

    blurb: 'Precipitation is the creation of a solid from a solution. This  is useful in the detection of the type of cation in a salt. To do this, an alkali first reacts with the unknown salt to produce a precipitate that is the hydroxide of the unknown salt. To identify the cation, the color of the precipitate and its solubility in excess are noted. For example, a barium nitrate solution will react with sulfate ions to form a solid barium sulfate precipitate, indicating that it is likely that sulfate ions are present.'
